      This project was a simple mod pack launcher made for the
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/imagin3_r3d">Imagine Team Red</a>(Mentioned
      here as Red)

      The idea for the project came to me while helping Red set up a Minecraft server for her and her viewers to play on. As I have hosting experience it
      wasn't too hard whoever we wanted to introduce mods but it would be too
      hard for her community to install mods on their clients, thus an idea to
      make a launcher. I was able to write all of the UI myself whoever
      The backend part was written by Jan (contributions visible on Github) the
      backend is based on an app-building framework called ElectronJS
