      There are many twitter accounts posting live tweets about locations with
      conflicts. However, it is difficult to keep track of the locations
      especially with multiple different sources pointing out different location
      every few minutes. To make sure people can stay safe and take care of
      themselves, we have aggregated all the tweets into a single map that is
      easily accessible.
