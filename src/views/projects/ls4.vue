     I worked on the launcher which players would interact with to create a lobby and join a game, The graphical design was made by me, Assisted by another team member with some CSS animations. Sadly the new-looking launcher was abandoned in favor of a more classic-looking one. At around this time, I also left the project due to time constraints and lack of creative will.
