      I worked on the launcher whitch players would interact with to create a
      lobby and join a game, The graphical desighn was made by me, Assisted by
      another team member with some css animations. Sadly the new looking
      launcher was abandoned in favour of a more classic looking one. At around
      this time i also left the project due to time constraints and lack of
      creative will.
