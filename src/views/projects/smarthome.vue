      This project was a simple modpack launcher made for the
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/imagin3_r3d">Imagine Team Red</a>(Mentioned
      here as Red)

      Thie idea for the project came to me while helping Red set up a minecraft
      server for her and her viewers to play on. As I have hosting experience it
      wasn't too hard whoever we wanted to introduce mods but it would be too
      hard for her comunity to install mods on thier clients, thus an idea to
      make a launcher. I was able to write all of the UI myself whoever the
      Backend part was written by Jan (contribuitins visible in github) the
      backend is based on an app building framework called ElectronJS
