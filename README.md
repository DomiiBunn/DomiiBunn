# 🙋‍♀️ Welcome

Hi there!

I'm Dominika(You can call me Bunny🐰)

I'm mostly self thought if it comes to coding. On the daily i struggle with customers at my company making sure thier internet works fine.

Currently i work as a network engineer with Ubiquity, Cisco, Routerboard and Dassan Networks hardware. Usually i have to diagnose issues with Radio signal(WISP) and some gPON issues. I'm one of three people responsible for the whole companies network.
