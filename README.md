# 🙋‍♀️ Welcome

Hi there!

I'm Dominika(You can call me Bunny🐰)

I'm mostly self-thought when it comes to coding. On a daily, I struggle with customers at my company making sure their internet works fine.

Currently, I work as a network engineer with Ubiquity, Cisco, Routerboard, and Dassan Networks hardware. Usually, I have to diagnose issues with Radio signal(WISP) and some gPON issues. I'm one of three people responsible for the whole companies network.
